# WeatherPy
Used the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated in the started code 

Created a scatter plot to showcase the relationship between Latitude vs. Temperature 

Created a scatter plot to showcase the relationship between Latitude vs. Humidity 

Created a scatter plot to showcase the relationship between Latitude vs. Cloudiness 

Created a scatter plot to showcase the relationship between Latitude vs. Wind Speed 

Linear regression scatter plot for Northern Hemisphere: Temperature (C) vs. Latitude 

Linear regression scatter plot for Southern Hemisphere: Temperature (C) vs. Latitude 

Linear regression scatter plot for Northern Hemisphere: Humidity (%) vs. Latitude 

Linear regression scatter plot for Southern Hemisphere: Humidity (%) vs. Latitude 

Linear regression scatter plot for Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude 

Linear regression scatter plot for Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude 

Linear regression scatter plot for Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed (m/s) vs. Latitude 

Linear regression scatter plot for Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed (m/s) vs. Latitude 
# VacationPy
Created a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame 

Narrowed down the city_data_df DataFrame to find the ideal weather condition for the dataset 

For each city in the hotel_df DataFrame, used the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 metres of your coordinates

Added the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city in the map.
